# Solidity_Beginner_Course
In this course I was learnt about Blockchain and Web3 along with the solidity programming. There are so many concepts of solidity I learnt from this course like as

1.Variables
2.Datatypes
3.Mapping
4.Functions etc,
Afterwards completion of this course I get a project to mint and burn a token with the help of solidity.

## Challenge_Overview

In this challenge I have to created contract name as MyToken give a string named "Tname" abbreviated as "Tabb" along with the record of its total supply (Initially set as zero). 
To run this mint and burn function i have to create a function MINT AND BURN FUNCTION
For mint , I put a Specific value to Mint it will increase the totalsupply and balance as well. (In this I used 400)
For Burn , I put a Specific value to Burn it will decrease the totalsupply and balance as well. (In this I  used 100)

### Steps_of_Challenge

* I used the Online Remix IDE for writing the solidity code Program with a version (pragma solidity 0.8.18).
* Then I created a file named as Atharva.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Compilation 

* If you are using The Remix IDE (Online Version) then you simply compile the code from the side menu given at the left side.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from side menu given at the left side.
* After deploying the code , you have to enter inputs according to requirement of mint and burn functions of the contract. 

## Help

I know little bit about this technology but in this platform i got a best opportunity to do it . The PATHWAYS are properly designed .
